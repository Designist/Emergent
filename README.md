# Emergent Communication
Previous work has shown that deep reinforcement learning agents are capable of developing rich communication protocols (Mordatch & Abbeel 2017; Hermann, et al. 2017). Under certain conditions, these protocols may result in grounded, compositional language-like structure. This project attempts to improve the quality of emergent communication through planning algorithms and computational pragmatic reasoning. Code written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
